# Boilerplate for layout tasks

Display six colored blocks on the screen without any extra margins:

- Each block should be 300px high.
- Block 1 must be red, block 2 must be 4 fifths red and 1 fifth black, block 3 
must be 3 fifths red and 2 fifths black, block 4 must be 2 fifths red and 3 
fifths black, block 5 must be 1 fifth red and 4 fifths black, block 6 must be 
black.
- Each block should have its number (1 to 6) placed in its center in white Arial 
100px font.
- Blocks must be put in 2 to 6 rows and stretched: each row must fit either 1, 
2, or 3 blocks so that the width of each block is not less than its height 
(300px).
- The first row is to be read from left ro right, the second row from right to 
left, the third row again from left to right (this way we have a zigzag, or a 
snake).

For better clarity, please refer to the reference [screenshots](references) at 
300, 450, 600, 750, 900, 1050, and 1200 pixel-wide screen.
