## The task
Display six colored blocks on the screen without any extra margins:

- Each block should be `300px` high.
- Each block should have its number (1 to 6) placed in its center in white Arial 100px font.
  - Block 1 must be `red`
  - Block 2 must be 4/5 `red` and 1/5 `black`
  - Block 3 must be 3/5 `red` and 2/5 `black`
  - Block 4 must be 2/5 `red` and 3/5 `black`
  - Block 5 must be 1/5 `red` and 4/5 `black`
  - Block 6 must be `black`.
- The width of each block should be not less than its height (`300px`)
- Blocks must be put in 2 to 6 rows and stretched: each row must fit either 1, 2, or 3 blocks.
  See the screenshots [here](./references).
- The first row is to be read from left ro right, the second row from right to left, the third row again from left to right (this way we have a zigzag, or a snake).
